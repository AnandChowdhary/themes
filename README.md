# üåà Anand's Themes

I use Yearly Themes from [The Theme System](https://www.themesystem.com) as an alternate to New Year's Resolutions. My yearly theme dictates my quarterly [OKRs](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/okrs) and helps me make decisions.

If you want an intro about themes, you can watch this [CGP Grey video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) on YouTube, but here's an excerpt from my blog post [2022 will be the Year of Teamwork](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/blog/blob/master/blog/2021/year-of-teamwork.md):

> [New Year's] Resolutions are specific goals, e.g., "I will lose X kg by Y date" or "I will go to the gym X times every week", which makes them very easy to fail. Themes, on the other hand, evolve to what you make of them. The idea is simple -- an overarching theme acts as a North Star and guides you in making microdecisions. Your theme might be "Year of Health", but what that meant to you when you started the year might be very different from where you end up, but that's the point -- themes are malleable. You might have started deadlifting, changed to core exercises, or switched to watching your diet -- the theme remains the same, health. Whether you're on major crossroads (e.g., "should I focus on mental health and quit my job?") or whether you're making a tiny decisions (e.g., "should I order take out or cook something?"), your theme pushes you in one or the other direction.
