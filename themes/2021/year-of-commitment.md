# Year of Commitment

I didn't write a blog post about my theme in 2021, but here's an excerpt from my blog post [2022 will be the Year of Teamwork](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/blog/blob/master/blog/2021/year-of-teamwork.md) which summarizes my thinking behind this theme:

> My theme for 2021 was **Year of Commitment**. In a post-pandemic world, I decided to double down on long-term goals (work, health, and personal life), and after living in India for most of the year, I wanted to move back to the Netherlands -- but not alone this time. In the last quarter of 2020, Sukriti and I started planning on moving to the Netherlands together, and applied to the master's program at the University of Groningen so she can study while I work. And like I said, Pabio is my first "real" full-time job, which may be surprising because I worked on Oswald Labs for almost four years, but I was never doing only one thing at a time. From Q4 2017 to Q4 2019, I was working on building Oswald Labs while also doing consulting work, while also doing a full-time bachelor's degree, while also being part of the honor's program, while also participating in every startup event I could find -- at some point, it adds up.

*More details will be added shortly!*
