# Year of Long Term

I didn't write a blog post about my theme in 2020, but here's an excerpt from my blog post [2022 will be the Year of Teamwork](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/blog/blob/master/blog/2021/year-of-teamwork.md) which summarizes my thinking behind this theme:

> 2020 was my **Year of Long Term**. I had just come back after living for a short while in the San Francisco Bay Area (after an exchange semester at Santa Clara University) and I knew that I'd be graduating from the University of Twente in 2020, so I had to decide where to focus my effort. I was almost certain that I didn't want to move back to India immediately, but I wasn't sure whether I want to get a job-job or work full-time on Oswald Labs. The one thing I knew for sure is that 2020 will determine what the rest of my 20s will be like, so it became the year where I say goodbye to myopic decisions and focus on the long term.

*More details will be added shortly!*
