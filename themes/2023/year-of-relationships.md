# Year of Relationships

I want to improve my relationships with my work, myself, and my surroundings in my Year of Relationships:

**I want a healthy relationship with my work.** I want to continue to work hard on my company. 2022 was my highest productivity year yet, and I don’t want that to change in 2023, while taking enough time off and maintaining a healthy balance. I also want to plan better and spend time in structured thinking.

Secondly, **I want a strong relationship with my body & mind.** One of the best things I did in 2022 was frequent gym and therapy sessions — training my body and mind. I want to continue to try and become the best version of myself.2023: Year of relationships

Finally, **I want to invest more in my support system and better maintain relationships.** One of my goals in 2022 was to find more time for my friends and family, and I did improve, but I want to try harder this year. I want to give back to the people who care for me, and be a better friend, and for the first time -- a husband.
