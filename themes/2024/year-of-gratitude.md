# Year of Gratitude

In 2024, I want to focus on the wellbeing of myself and those around me:

**I want to focus on my mental health** and give myself time to exercise, introspect, and learn. I want to properly take Sundays off and spend more time with myself and my loved ones, and I want to see my personal trainer and my therapist with more regularity and review my goals frequently.

Secondly, **I want to actively practice gratitude** to be more thankful for everything I have. I want to be more appreciative of the people in my life, which starts with more frequent calls to my family and friends. I also want to write more often to be better in touch with my thoughts, be it blog posts, journal entries, emails, letters, or even tweets.

Finally, **I want to be a better community member** and give back to the people around me. I want to be more involved in the communities I'm a part of, be it founders, Utrechters, family and friends, or humans. I want to be there for people when they need me, and I want to expand my network to meet new people to learn from.
